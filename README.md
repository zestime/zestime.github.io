# How to run

This is based on Jekyll. So, we need some gems

```
$ gem install bundler jekyll
```

Then, we need to install dependent packages. It will downloads lots of packages, for example, theme and markdown.

```
$ bundle install
```

Finally, we can run this site

```
$ bundle exec 'JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll serve'
```
